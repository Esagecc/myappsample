Sample files for tutorial of how to update files with gitbash and VSC.

I was finally able to use git to add, commit, push and status.

I had previously tried to use git to add files on github, but VSC made it complicated for me. Even though I would download git and managed to add path, it would never work. It was adding my frustration.

However, I want to be a web developer and being able to use git well is definite criteria. 

For anyone that needs help to figure it out as well. Here is the link the youtube vidoe that helped me.
